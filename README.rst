ghini.pocket
============================

ghini.pocket is a tiny android data viewer. you would find it handy if you
want to have a quick idea of a plant species, origin, and date it entered
the garden, just by scanning a plant label.

- install `**ghini.pocket** <http://www.ghini.me/ghini.pocket.apk>`_ on your android device,
- start ghini.pocket,
- search for plant code ``0`` (this creates the database location),
- search for plant code ``settings`` (this tells you the database location),
- use **ghini.desktop** to export your garden database to a reduced SQLite3 database,
- copy the reduced database file to the device (this and the previous step you repeat from time to time),
- scan a plant code (or type it),
- see the most relevant details about the plant.
